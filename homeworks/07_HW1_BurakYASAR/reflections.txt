estimate of the time spent on this exercise: 5 hour

the status of code: working

keep a record of what you do --in particular
--------------------------------------------
I emerged all pieces and when I run the program at first time of course it did not work
I debuged the code traced it line by line and I fixed it

what went wrong and how you went about fixing it
------------------------------------------------
some codes was not written well(some of them was very useful especially I'd like to thank you also I'd like to thank you those who strive ),
none of group know about how did the others think while they are coding.
one of the main problem was some codes did not include necessary things. I mean for example some get methods
were extremely significant and they did not used. StringBuffer types should have been turned into Strings to
be able to use the necessary methods of string. That's why String types get methods are important. Some codes
include it however some did not implement.

Another thing that I want to mention about tryThis method, when the user types a letter which is either not in the 
alphabet or was used before numberOfIncorrectTries should have been implemented but it was not.
Whatever, again I fixed it and of course it was long piece of code and maybe there was lack of interest  but most importantly
there was lack of communication. It is normal to encounter these problems.

what might be done to avoid similar difficulties in the future.

In the future, everyone can encourage each other or study more carefully.
